# Flying Dudes: A Blast from the Past!

Hey there, fellow time travelers! üëã Welcome to the Flying Dudes repo, a nostalgic journey back to 2014 when my buddy Antoine and I were just a couple of wide-eyed SI4 students trying to impress our Computer Control prof, Jean-Paul Stromboni.

## What's This All About?

Picture this: It's 2014, Pharrell's "Happy" is playing everywhere, and we're coding like mad to create this wacky game where dudes fly around collecting targets. Why? Because college, that's why! üéì

Fast forward to today (holy cow, has it really been 10 years?), and I've decided to dust off this old gem and give it a modern makeover with Next.js. Why? Because nostalgia is one hell of a drug, my friends!

## The Time Machine (aka Live Demo)

Wanna see what happens when you mix 2014 creativity with 2024 tech? Check out the live demo at https://flying-dudes.pages.dev/. Warning: May cause uncontrollable urges to relive your college days!

## A Trip Down Memory Lane

For those history buffs out there (or if you just want a good laugh), the original 2014 version is safely tucked away in the "master-2014" branch. It's like a digital time capsule, minus the buried-in-the-backyard part.

## Fire It Up!

Feeling nostalgic and want to run this bad boy locally? Here's how:

1. Clone this repo (like it's 2014 all over again)
2. Run `npm install` (some things never change)
3. Hit it with `npm run dev`
4. Travel back in time to http://localhost:3000

## The Authentic Experience

In the spirit of true nostalgia and authenticity, we've kept the game in its original, slightly broken state. Yes, that means some features might not work perfectly, and there might be a bug or two (or ten). But hey, that's part of the charm, right? It's like playing an old NES game - blowing on the cartridge is half the fun!

## Want to Contribute?

Did this blast from the past inspire you? Got some ideas to make Flying Dudes even cooler? Pull requests are welcome! Just remember, with great power comes great responsibility (and potential for adding more flying dudes).

## License to Chill

This project is as free as we thought we were in college. Use it, abuse it, love it. Just maybe buy Antoine and me a beer if you make millions off it, yeah?

Shoutout to Antoine Lavail, my partner in crime for this project. Dude, if you're reading this, remember when we thought this would make us the next big thing in gaming? Good times! üçª

And to Professor Stromboni - I hope we finally nailed that A+ we were gunning for. Better late than never, right?

Here's to code that stands the test of time, friendships forged in the fires of debugging, and the eternal question: "Why the heck did we call it Flying Dudes anyway?"

Keep on flying, dudes and dudettes! üöÄ
